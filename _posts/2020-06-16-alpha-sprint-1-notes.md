About the project
=================

The income management system (IMS) project is in alpha. The project is a collaboration between three Councils: Barnsley, Dorset and Huntingdonshire. The future vision of the work is to create: a supported payment and income service designed by local government for local government - that improves the current experience for users by introducing greater choice and flexibility, and providing value for money by reducing total cost of ownership.

What’s been happening 
======================

At the beginning of last week we continued to progress our first sprint, this ended on Tuesday, and we held our first show and tell in the afternoon. [Here are the show and tell slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g0mavgV3Vavor16CLFI3oiysTUqp2-u8G9QwRyen9HI). 

We got an enormous amount done in the first sprint, understanding how the IMS fits into a wider ecosystems of processes and technology solutions. We defined our research plan to extend the things that the discovery found with specifics about how councils procure their IMS. And we explored the likely technical architecture, both in terms of the target infrastructure and the features that we expect to ‘bundle’ with the IMS.

A team retrospective found that we needed more shared clarity about what the future IMS looked like in practice, and to better understand how the IMS would be used by other Councils. We had a good discussion around both these things which are essential to understand, and considered them when shaping our second sprint. 

Sprint two 
===========

Sprint two started on Thursday.

The goal of the second sprint is to: define a first iteration of a scope for the future IMS. Although we know about many of the separate components that make up the future service, we don’t yet understand how all the components fit together - so this is what we want to understand this sprint.  The aim for sprint three will be to test the future IMS.

We’re continuing to design the core features in parallel, and we held a second co-design session for this.

We’ve been progressing discussions about the architecture, infrastructure and technical governance of the future service. This work is being led by our project design board, which is represented by each of the three Councils.

We’re putting out a survey to get more understanding of when and how councils procure a new IMS and we’re recruiting more research participants for sprint three. 

We’ve also been thinking about project comms and how we may engage future users of the IMS, by talking about the project in the open and involving interested parties in the discussion as we progress. 

Things to address 
==================

Our designer will be leaving the team soon, and they will need to be replaced. We’ve identified someone who may be able to take this work on, which we need to confirm as soon as possible.
