Many of the team are not full-time on the project and we are using Slack to give visibility of activities for those not able to make the stand-up.

In our first sprint planning session we refined the alpha vision and goals, and identified and agreed core alpha activities, thinking about the outputs we’re seeking. We also identified which team members would contribute to which activity.
